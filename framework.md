# 5209 Interface Analysis and design Assessment 03 part A 

## What frameworks did I look into and why? 

### I looked into bootstrap, CSS Grids, Foundation, React and Material. The two that I liked the most were Bootstrap and Material. The reason I looked into these frameworks is because I was looking for a framework that is free so there is no initial start up cost. It also had to be open source and have good support with help over the internet. This helps when looking for solutions to problems that may occur. The frameworks also had to have a good range of JavaScript libraries so the functionality is easier to show in the template design stages to see if things are going to work the way I think they are going to. With the libraries I can do this without having to create much JavaScript myself. They are both well established and have been around for 5 - 6 Years so they have run the test of time. They also look like they are going to stay around for the next 5 years because of how popular they are. They are both compatible with most web browsers. They both have mobile capabilities this is important because most people are using their phones on the internet not a laptop or computer. They both support a responsive design and allow the web page to load fast. This will ensure that the user isn't waiting around for the page to load.



## The framework I decide to use for my final design

### I am going to pick bootstrap to do this web application. This is because it has good online tutorials and information so it will be less time consuming to do problem solving. Bootstrap has a large active following so there is a lot of support from 3rd party members. Also it supports a large supply of JavaScript libraries so it will be more productive for me to implement javascript using this. Bootstrap is about six years old so I know that a lot of things have been Tried and I should be able to find the answer to most every question I have. Bootstrap has a toolkit for different screen resolutions devices and screen sizes so it is going to work cross platform and will be able to accompany multiple screen sizes within that device and in different devices. Bootstrap has a good responsive design and will load fast on the initial and extended web search. 


### I was really close to wanting to pick material and I think that it could still be a good option. It also has most of the features that bootstrap has. The design looks good and I think in some cases that my design might look more like some of the designs that are in the material templates but the reason I didnâ€™t pick this one is because I couldn't find as much information as I did on bootstrap. I have also learnt and used a bit of bootstrap before and I thought trying to learn something completely new in three weeks might not be the best option.
